## Server Compatibility/Requirement

Standard Plex requirement for streaming to Plex Home Theater (PHT)

High CPU requirement for transcoding to other clients (Web/Android/Roku/FireTV/etcâ€¦). Typical NAS devices may not have capable CPU for transcoding.

Estimated CPU requirement for 1080i MPEGTS transcoding:
- Intel Core2 Quad 2.5Ghz or faster.
- Intel Celeron/Pentium Gxxxx 3Ghz or faster.
- Intel i3/i5/i7 Dual Core (1st Generation) 3Ghz of faster.
- Intel i3/i5/i7 Dual Core (Later Generation) Turbo Speed 2.5Ghz or faster.
- AMD Athlon Quad Core 3Ghz or faster.
- AMD AthlonII/Phenom/A6/A8/A10 Quad Core 2.5Ghz or faster.

## Client Compatibility

Some browser may have playback issues with HTML5 player, disable HTML5 player.

### Full compatibility:
- Android 6 (HTC 10)
- Chrome - Disable HTML5 player if there are playback issues.

### Limited compatibility
- HTC M7 (Android 5) - Use External Player (VLC) but doesn't seem to transcode?
- Firefox - Disable HTML5 player
- Plex Media Player (PMP) - PMS does not transcode to PMP, therefore high bandwidth required. No remote viewing capabilities, maybe possible with VPN but still requires high bandwidth. 

### Not Compatible

## Known Anomalies

###Interlacing

There is no known method of forcing deinterlacing support from plug-in level. Deinterlacing is achieved by replacing xml profiles, <https://github.com/zynine-/PlexDeinterlaceProfiles>.

###Slow buffer or stutters on some clients

On some clients, setting a lower stream quality may increase loading, or stutters. This is due to the video chunk size; PMS seem to love 4MB chunk sizes.

Ways to reduce loading times or stutters:
- Disable HTML5 if you are using a browser
- Set higher quality, or the highest your network bandwidth/connection allows.
