## Code Improvement / Bug Fixes

Erm, My code may suck because I'm not a python coder. Feel free to give suggestions or do minor fixes.

## Feature Request

Feel free to ask, but I can't guarantee anything.

## Documentation / How-to's

Help with documentation is always great. I have limited hardware setups or environment setups. Feel free to write documentation for other system setups.
